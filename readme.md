# Task Management App

### Programming language: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This app is designed to create a list of tasks.
User enter data like Name, Category, Deadline, and Status of work. 
After entering the information and store into an arrey, the data is listed in the UI in form of a list.
User is able to add new task. Delete the last entry. Change the status of work by entering the name and updating the status option, after that ckick on Change status button to update the list.
Task will update automatically if any task is past due date, and change status to "Overdue"

Challenges faced are the function and how thay work together.
Solution, was one funtion at the time, small lines of code, little by little functions start to interact with eache-other.
Many ways to approuch a solution. With more time i will have to work on any function to reduce the code and css styling to make it nice
